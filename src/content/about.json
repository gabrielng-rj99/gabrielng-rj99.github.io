    "bio": "I grew up in a favela in Rio de Janeiro, and I was lucky to have access to resources and opportunities to study that I didn't waste.\n\nSince I was young, using tools like Hamachi and proxies to play with friends, I learned about networks, NAT, and subnets. My curiosity led me to explore modding games, understanding versioning (patches), binaries, and the difference between compiled and non-compiled code. This early exposure showed me that technology was my path, even though I explored other areas.\n\nMy goal is to develop digital solutions that reduce dependency on big techs, protect our data, and combat digital colonialism, ensuring that our digital resources stay within our control and benefit.",
